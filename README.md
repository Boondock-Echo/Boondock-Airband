# RTLSDR-Airband

 
 


## Overview

RTLSDR-Airband receives analog radio voice channels and produces
audio streams which can be routed to various outputs, such as online
streaming services like LiveATC.net. Originally the only SDR type
supported by the program was Realtek DVB-T dongle (hence the project's
name). However, thanks to SoapySDR vendor-neutral SDR library, other
radios are now supported as well.
